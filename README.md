# HTML and CSS examples 

**This repository consists of a couple html and css examples one of which is a periodic table and another is a simple login page. The periodic table was part of a group project while the login page was simply made for fun.**

## Getting Started 

Our group worked on making the periodic table for the ChemTutor website. Most of the code for the periodic table was already available to us in HTML and CSS but we took some time to figure out how everything worked.  
The static page simply involves the periodic table with color coded categories and a description of those color codes in the legend. We worked with the 'box-sizing: border-box' property which applies to all the elements in the HTML file. In order to maintain the structure of the periodic table, we made the boxes in the empty "li" tags non-responsive to the cursor and their borders invisible. 
The periodic table might be imported by various other parts of the website as appropriate using <frameset>, <frame> tags or through HTML5 template engines like Thymeleaf. 

In order to view the page, the browser must support HTML5.
